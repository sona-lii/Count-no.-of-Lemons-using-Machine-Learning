# Count-number-of-Lemons-using-Machine-Learning
Objective: To segment and count all the lemons present in an image given by the user

Here, I developed a python based tool to read an image given by the user, segment and count the number
of lemons in the image. Accept the image input by the user and display the result along with
each lemon segmented separately, count of lemons in the image and time taken for code to
execute. Generalize the thresholds in your code so as to detect and count lemons in a variety of
images.
